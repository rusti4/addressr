Stuff like deploy should use dagger.io because it has specific dependencies like terraform
or we could have convetions in the npm scripts that they call dagger.io if needed but otherwise
they're just normal npm scripts.

In this way dagger becomes our way to compose and orchestrate our build and deploy scripts

actions:
    scripts for doing stuff.
